# Test Runner Button Fix
**Date:** 2025-09-08
**Issue:** "Run All Tests" and "Run Unit Tests" buttons not working
**Status:** FIXED ✅

## Problem
The test runner buttons weren't triggering test execution when clicked.

## Root Causes

### 1. Inline onclick handlers issue
The buttons were using inline `onclick="runAllTests()"` but the functions were defined inside a module scope and not accessible globally.

### 2. Script loading timing
The external test file wasn't being properly loaded and executed before trying to call its functions.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Replaced inline onclick with event listeners
```html
<!-- Before -->
<button onclick="runAllTests()">Run All Tests</button>

<!-- After -->
<button id="run-all-tests">Run All Tests</button>
```

Then added proper event listeners in JavaScript:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    document.getElementById('run-all-tests').addEventListener('click', function() {
        window.runAllTests();
    });
});
```

### 2. Fixed script loading timing
- Added `setTimeout` to wait for script to fully execute
- Check for `window.runMemoryGameTests` instead of just `runMemoryGameTests`
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Display results after running external tests

### 3. Enhanced debugging
Added console.log statements to track:
- When buttons are clicked
- When test file loads
- Whether external tests are found
- Any errors during loading

## Files Modified
- `tests/test-runner.html` - Fixed button handlers and script loading

## How to Test

1. Run the test suite:
```bash
./test_simple.bash
```

2. Open browser console (F12) to see debug messages

3. Click "Run All Tests" button

4. You should see:
   - Console: "Run All Tests clicked"
   - Console: "Test file loaded successfully"
   - Console: "Running memory game tests from external file..."
   - UI: 19 tests running and results displayed

## What Happens Now

1. Page loads → Event listeners attached
2. Click button → Event listener fires
3. Load external test file → Wait for execution
4. Run tests → Display results

## Debugging Tips

If tests still don't run:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify file path: `/tests/unit/memory-game.test.js`
3. Check if `window.runMemoryGameTests` exists
4. Try clearing browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

## Browser Console Commands

To manually test:
```javascript
// Check if function exists
typeof window.runMemoryGameTests

// Run tests manually
window.runAllTests()

// Check test framework
window.testFramework.results
```
