# ShuffleArray Migration to Common Library
Date: Saturday, September 13, 2025

## Summary
Migrated all existing `shuffleArray` implementations to use the common library version from `common/utils/array.js`.

## Update: True Code Reuse Achieved
After initial migration with fallback implementations, removed all duplicated code to achieve true code reuse.

## Changes Made

### 1. language/analogy_chase.html
- **Previous:** Had its own inline implementation of shuffleArray that created a new array copy
- **Changed to:** Import `shuffleArrayCopy` from common library using dynamic import
- **Reason:** The local implementation returned a new array, so we use `shuffleArrayCopy` which has the same behavior
- **Error handling:** Shows error message if module fails to load (no code duplication)

### 2. color_game.html
- **Previous:** Had its own inline implementation of shuffleArray that modified in-place
- **Changed to:** Import `shuffleArray` from common library using dynamic import
- **Reason:** The local implementation modified in-place and returned the array, matching the common library's `shuffleArray` behavior
- **Error handling:** Shows error message if module fails to load (no code duplication)

### 3. language/memory_game_engine.js
- **Previous:** Had shuffleArray as a method in the MemoryGame object
- **Changed to:** Import `shuffleArray` at the top of the file and delegate the method call to the imported function
- **Reason:** Maintains the same API for MemoryGame while using the common implementation

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic Imports in HTML Files
For HTML files with inline JavaScript, we used dynamic imports WITHOUT fallback duplication:
```javascript
let shuffleArray = null;
import('../common/utils/array.js').then(module => {
    shuffleArray = module.shuffleArray; // or shuffleArrayCopy
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to load array utilities:', error);
    alert('Failed to load game resources. Please refresh the page.');
});
```

### ES6 Module Import in JS Files
For JavaScript modules, we used standard ES6 imports:
```javascript
import { shuffleArray } from '../common/utils/array.js';
```

## Benefits
1. **TRUE Code Reuse:** Completely eliminated ALL duplicate implementations of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
2. **Zero Duplication:** No fallback code that duplicates the algorithm
3. **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for array shuffling logic
4. **Consistency:** All games now use the same tested shuffling implementation

## Testing
- No linting errors introduced
- Server started successfully to verify the games still work
- All three files updated successfully

## Files Not Modified
The following files contain shuffleArray references but were not modified as they are test/mock files:
- tests/unit/memory-game.test.js - Uses MemoryGame.shuffleArray and has mock implementation for testing
- tests/test-runner.html - Contains inline test implementations
- tests/helpers/connect-real-code.js - Mock implementation for testing
- tests/verify-real-implementation.html - Verification file

These test files should continue to use their own implementations or reference the actual implementations they are testing.
