# Analogy Files Reorganization

## Date: 2025-09-13

## Summary
Moved analogy JSON files from `language/data/` to a dedicated `language/analogy_data/` directory for better organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Moves
Moved the following files from `language/data/` to `language/analogy_data/`:
- `analogies.json`
- `analogies_addition_1.json`
- `analogies_addition_2.json`

### 2. Code Updates
- Updated `language/analogy_chase.html` with comments indicating the new location of analogy JSON files
- Added helpful notes for future developers who might want to load the JSON files dynamically

## Technical Details

### Current Implementation
- The `analogy_chase.html` file currently uses hardcoded analogy data (embedded directly in the JavaScript)
- The JSON files are not actively being loaded by any existing code
- The move does not affect the functionality of any existing features

### Future Considerations
If someone wants to update `analogy_chase.html` to load data dynamically from the JSON files, they should:
1. Use `fetch('./analogy_data/analogies.json')` or similar for the other files
2. Parse the JSON and use it to populate the `analogiesData` variable
3. Consider implementing a file selection mechanism if multiple analogy files should be available

## Files Affected
- `language/data/` - Removed 3 analogy JSON files
- `language/analogy_data/` - Added 3 analogy JSON files
- `language/analogy_chase.html` - Added documentation comments

## Testing
- The analogy chase game continues to work with the hardcoded data
- The JSON files are accessible in their new location
- No other parts of the codebase were affected by this change
