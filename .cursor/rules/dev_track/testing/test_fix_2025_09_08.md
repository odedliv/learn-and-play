# Test Runner Fix - Loading External Test Files
**Date:** 2025-09-08
**Issue:** Only 6 tests showing instead of 19
**Status:** FIXED ✅

## Problem
User reported seeing only 6 tests when running `./test_simple.bash`, but we documented 19 tests.

## Root Cause
The `test-runner.html` was only running **inline example tests** (6 tests in 3 suites) and was NOT loading the actual test file `tests/unit/memory-game.test.js` which contains the full 19 tests.

### What Was Happening:
- **test-runner.html**: Had 6 inline example tests
- **memory-game.test.js**: Had 19 full tests but wasn't being loaded

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `test-runner.html`
- Added code to dynamically load `memory-game.test.js`
- Tries to run `runMemoryGameTests()` if available
- Falls back to inline tests if external file fails to load
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. Updated `memory-game.test.js`
- Changed from ES6 module export to global function
- `export function runMemoryGameTests()` → `window.runMemoryGameTests = function()`
- This makes the function accessible to the test runner

## Files Modified
1. `tests/test-runner.html` - Added dynamic script loading
2. `tests/unit/memory-game.test.js` - Changed to global function

## How It Works Now

```javascript
// test-runner.html now does this:
1. Creates a <script> tag for memory-game.test.js
2. Loads the file
3. Checks if runMemoryGameTests() exists
4. Runs all 19 tests from the file
5. Falls back to 6 inline tests if loading fails
```

## Test Count Breakdown

### Full Suite (19 tests):
- **Memory Game - Shuffle Function**: 6 tests
- **Memory Game - Format Topic Name**: 4 tests
- **Memory Game - Pair Matching Logic**: 2 tests
- **Memory Game - Game State Management**: 3 tests
- **Memory Game - Data Preparation**: 3 tests

### Inline Examples (6 tests):
- **Array Utilities**: 2 tests
- **Game State**: 2 tests
- **Data Validation**: 2 tests

## To Verify Fix

Run the test suite again:
```bash
./test_simple.bash
```

You should now see:
- **5 test suites** (not 3)
- **19 tests total** (not 6)
- All tests passing ✅

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify test counts** match documentation
2. **Test loaders need to actually load test files** (not just have them exist)
3. **Module systems matter** - ES6 modules vs global functions
4. **Browser console is helpful** - Shows if files are loading

## Next Steps

Now that all 19 tests are running:
1. Connect tests to real `memory_game_engine.js` implementation
2. Add more test cases
3. Create integration tests
4. Add test coverage reporting
