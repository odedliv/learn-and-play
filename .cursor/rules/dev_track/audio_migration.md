# Audio Functions Migration to Common Library
Date: Saturday, September 13, 2025

## Summary
Migrated all existing audio implementations to use the common library functions from `common/audio/sounds.js`.

## Sound Mapping
- **Success sounds** (correct answers) → `playSuccessSound()`
- **Error sounds** (incorrect answers) → `playErrorSound()`
- **Victory sounds** (game won) → `playVictorySound()`
- **Game over sounds** (game lost - chase only) → `playGameOverSound()`

## Changes Made

### 1. language/memory_game_engine.js
- **Previous:** Custom AudioContext implementation for success sound
- **Changed to:** Import `playSuccessSound` and `playVictorySound` from common library
- **Additions:**
  - Added `initAudio()` call in `init()` method
  - Replaced custom `playSuccessSound()` with library function
  - Added `playVictorySound()` when game is won

### 2. division_with_remainder.html
- **Previous:** Custom AudioContext implementation with note sequences for correct/incorrect
- **Changed to:** Import and use common library functions
- **Replacements:**
  - `playCorrectSound()` → `playSuccessSound()`
  - `playIncorrectSound()` → `playErrorSound()`
- **Implementation:** Uses dynamic import with React useRef to load the audio module

### 3. division_signs.html
- **Previous:** Used Tone.js library for sound synthesis
- **Changed to:** Import and use common library functions
- **Removals:**
  - Removed Tone.js CDN dependency
  - Removed Tone.Synth and Tone.MembraneSynth instances
- **Replacements:**
  - Tone.js success arpeggio → `playSuccessSound()`
  - Tone.js error sound → `playErrorSound()`

### 4. language/analogy_chase.html
- **Previous:** No audio implementation
- **Added:** Complete audio support using common library
- **New sounds:**
  - Success sound when answering correctly
  - Error sound when answering incorrectly
  - Victory sound when winning the game
  - Game over sound when losing (caught by chaser)

## Implementation Patterns

### ES6 Module Import (JavaScript files)
```javascript
import { initAudio, playSuccessSound, playVictorySound } from '../common/audio/sounds.js';
```

### Dynamic Import (HTML files with inline JavaScript)
```javascript
let audioModule = null;
import('./common/audio/sounds.js').then(module => {
    audioModule = module;
    audioModule.initAudio();
});
```

### React Component Pattern
```javascript
const audioModule = useRef(null);
useEffect(() => {
    import('./common/audio/sounds.js').then(module => {
        audioModule.current = module;
        audioModule.current.initAudio();
    });
}, []);
```

## Benefits
1. **Consistency:** All games now use the same audio feedback patterns
2. **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for all audio implementations
3. **Simplification:** Removed complex custom audio code and external dependencies (Tone.js)
4. **Better UX:** Added audio feedback to games that previously had none (analogy_chase)
5. **Code Reduction:** Eliminated ~100+ lines of custom audio code across files

## Technical Notes
- All imports include error handling for module loading failures
- Audio initialization happens on first user interaction (required by browsers)
- The common library uses both Web Audio API and Tone.js for optimal sound quality
- No breaking changes to game functionality

## Files Not Modified
The following games don't currently have audio (could be added in future):
- bomb_multiplications.html - No audio implementation (could add sounds)
- color_game.html - No audio implementation (could add sounds)

Note: bomb_multiplications should NOT have game over sound on failure (as specified), only success sounds could be added.
