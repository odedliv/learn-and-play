# Testing Expansion - Memory Game

## Date: 2025-09-13

## Summary
Added 10 new tests to the memory game test suite, expanding coverage for score tracking, win conditions, and card state management.

## Tasks Completed

### From next-steps-guide.md Goal 3
✅ Added tests that:
- Matched cards stay visible
- Score increases correctly
- Topic name formats correctly
- Win conditions are properly detected

### From todo_testing.md Phase 2
✅ Completed:
- Tests for `prepareGameData()` with both JSON formats
- Tests for win condition and score calculation
- Tests for topic name formatting with special characters
- Tests for game reset functionality

## Test Coverage Expansion

### Previous State
- 18 tests in 6 test suites
- Basic shuffle and game state tests

### Current State
- **28 tests in 8 test suites**
- Added 10 new tests

### New Test Suites Added
1. **Memory Game - Score Tracking** (3 tests)
   - Track matched pairs count
   - Reset score when game resets
   - Format score display correctly

2. **Memory Game - Win Condition** (3 tests)
   - Detect win when all pairs are found
   - Trigger win message at right time
   - Handle different total pairs settings

3. **Memory Game - Card State After Match** (3 tests)
   - Keep matched cards visible
   - Prevent clicking matched cards
   - Add success animation to matched cards

### Enhanced Test Suite
**Memory Game - Format Topic Name** (1 additional test)
- Added test for predefined topic name mappings
- Now uses real implementation when available

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Tests use real `MemoryGame` object when available
- Fallback to mock implementations for isolation
- Tests mirror actual game behavior from `memory_game_engine.js`

### Key Test Patterns
```javascript
// Score tracking pattern
const gameState = {
    pairsFound: 0,
    totalPairs: 10,
    handleMatch() {
        this.pairsFound++;
    }
};

// Win condition pattern
if (this.pairsFound === this.totalPairs) {
    this.winTriggered = true;
}

// Card state pattern
card.isMatched = true;
card.isFlipped = true; // Keeps flipped class
```

## Testing Philosophy Applied
1. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Tests focus on what the game does, not how
2. **Real implementation preferred** - Uses actual `MemoryGame` functions when available
3. **Edge cases covered** - Tests include boundary conditions and special cases
4. **Hebrew support verified** - Tests include Hebrew text handling

## Files Modified
1. `tests/unit/memory-game.test.js` - Added 10 new tests
2. `tests/next-steps-guide.md` - Updated progress tracking
3. `todo_testing.md` - Marked completed tasks

## Next Steps
Remaining Phase 2 tasks:
- [ ] Test card click handling edge cases (double-click, spam clicking)
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Add test fixtures for data

## Test Results
All 28 tests pass with the real implementation loaded.

## Lessons Learned
- The real `formatTopicName` function uses predefined mappings for common topics
- Score tracking is directly tied to `pairsFound` counter
- Win detection happens immediately when `pairsFound === totalPairs`
- Matched cards maintain their flipped state for visibility
